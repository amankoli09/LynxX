        q: "Is StellarFlow custodial? Who holds my funds?",
        a: "Never us. StellarFlow is fully non-custodial — your keys live in your Freighter wallet and you sign every transaction yourself. We never touch, hold, or move your funds.",
    },
    {
        q: "What does it cost to send a payment?",
        a: "Stellar charges a base fee of 0.00001 XLM per transaction — a fraction of a cent. There are no platform fees on top; you only pay the network.",
    },
    {
        q: "How fast do transactions settle?",
        a: "Stellar reaches consensus in about 5 seconds, so your payment is final almost instantly — no waiting for block confirmations.",
    },
    {
        q: "Is the crowdfunding really on-chain?",
        a: "Yes. Donations are real Soroban smart-contract calls on Stellar Testnet. Funds move trustlessly into the contract, progress updates from on-chain events, and the beneficiary withdraws directly — no backend in the middle.",
    },
    {
        q: "Do I need real money to try it?",
        a: "No. StellarFlow runs on Stellar Testnet, so you use free test XLM. Just create a wallet in Freighter, switch to Testnet, and fund it from the friendbot.",
